Recently Word Lions presented a proposal to a relatively new client. We present proposals all the time, but this one frightened us a little bit.

After our internal review process for this proposal, Joel said, "we're either going to blow their minds or blow their tops." He was right. We were in the exciting but uncomfortable position of presenting something **new** and **different** to our client.

I think what made me uncomfortable about this is that our client hadn't really asked for something new and different. They'd asked for a solution to a training challenge, and we'd done what we always do, which is try to look underneath what they were asking for to discover any deeper needs they hadn't expressed.

In this particular case, our client requested a proposal for some fairly conventional elearning. We delivered that proposal, but we also delivered a proposal for some additional real-world interaction content that used game elements like playing cards and a score sheet. We felt strongly that this interaction content would address a vital need for more effective training than elearning alone could provide.

Ultimately, our client liked the idea, had some great feedback, and our fears about blowing tops were proved baseless. When I think about it, it seems like that uncomfortable excitement about presenting an idea might be a signal that we're headed in the right direction; that we've done a good job of listening to our client and created a solution that delights rather than just satisfies.
