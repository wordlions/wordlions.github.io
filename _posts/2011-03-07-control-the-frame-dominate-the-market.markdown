It looks like the discussion of framing is going to be an ongoing one here at Word Lions central. Here's our [previous post](http://wordlions.com/587/how-to-win-any-argument/) on the subject. We strongly believe that when you think about how you discuss your product, you must consider how you are going to frame the discussion. If you don't frame your argument, your competitors will do it for you.

A nice example comes from current events. During the media event announcing Apple's iPad 2, Steve Jobs said:


> "This is worth repeating. It’s in Apple’s DNA that technology is not enough. It’s tech married with the liberal arts and the humanities. Nowhere is that more true than in the post-PC products. Our competitors are looking at this like it’s the next PC market. That is not the right approach to this. These are post-PC devices that need to be easier to use than a PC. More intuitive.


There you have it; a clear example of framing. Let's break it down a bit. When Apple uses the term "post-PC" to frame the discussion around mobile devices, here's what they mean:



	
  * The Apple IOS products (iPod, iPhone, iPad) are not PCs. This means that all the expectations and conventions that have been built up around PCs are out the window when Apple uses this new frame for discussing their IOS products. All the "well, the iPad can't..." critiques don't really apply because they're based on PC norms and expectations. Translation: Apple doesn't have to play by their competitors' rules.

	
  * To be a post-PC product, you have to have an intuitive (probably touch-based) interface and tight integration between the operating system and the hardware. Translation: If you aren't HP or RIM, you don't have even the prerequisites to compete in the Apple-defined post-PC market.

	
  * By differentiating their IOS products from PC's, Apple gains greater latitude in marketing. Translation: post-PC devices can be defined in a way that provides an advantage to Apple.


It may seem like a small bit of terminology, but Apple's use of the word "post-PC" is an important part of framing the discussion to their own advantage. If you buy into Apple's use of "post-PC," you automatically buy into all the assumptions they've tied to the term. And that benefits Apple.

**Update:**

[This excellent discussion](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2292081) on Hacker news brings up a good counterpoint, and leads with the simple question, "Why are Apple's post-PC devices dependent on PCs?" To complete the initial setup on an IOS device, you must plug it into a PC using a USB cable. Google's Android has proved that you can create mobile devices that are completely untethered from a PC, so we know its possible, even though Apple hasn't implemented things this way. So is it disingenuous for Apple to refer to these devices as post-PC, even though they depend on a PC ?

I don't think so. Apple's marketing team is doing exactly what a good marketing team is supposed to: differentiating their product from the competition in vivid, memorable ways. One of the ways they're doing that is creating terminology that consolidates a list of product characteristics and benefits into a single term. It's just that they're trying to get ahead of the competition by laying claim to new terminology early in the game, and because it's early in the game lots of things are still fluid and undefined.

I'm not trying to defend Apple here. It seems like if they wanted to, they could have incorporated over-the-air syncing into IOS by now, and completely untethered their IOS devices from PCs. It's certainly debatable whether tethering IOS devices to iTunes is a customer-friendly move or one that is more focused on profit at the expense of user experience. But Apple is certainly following marketing best practices when they create vivid, memorable terminology like "post-PC" to describe their IOS devices. And we can all learn a thing or two from that.
