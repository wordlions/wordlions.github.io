If you wanted to guarantee that someone finishes what they started, how might you go about that?

I propose that you might make their payment contingent on their finishing the work. Payment on completion is a great idea, and it's part of what makes hiring out certain kinds of work so damn efficient. (The other way to help a person or team finish a project is to set a public deadline, but that's for another blog post.)

## Full Time Employees and the Unfinished Valley

We love full time employees (FTEs). They're the engine of the world economy, but one flaw with having FTEs do certain things--say like writing those three case studies you've been meaning to get out the door this quarter--is that they get paid whether they finish that task or not. In some cases this can dis-incentivize *finishing stuff*. Now if they don't finish *any* tasks, they'll probably get a ticket to the unemployment line, but it's so easy for small tasks to get pushed down to the bottom of an FTE's TODO list while they are handling other priorities.

It's hard to see it while they're in the conceptual phase and haven't been written yet, but those case studies and other sales collatoral have **real value**. They can fill a sales funnel, or help turn prospects into customers.

We've found that a lot of content projects--especially those that have a technical component--tend to languish on the back burner. They get stuck in the "Unfinished Valley" because they are not the primary priority of your technical resources, and the marketing team is often overloaded with high-value strategic tasks.

## Partner With a Finisher

What's the solution to overloaded FTEs who can't push those small projects up and out of the Unfinished Valley? You need a **finisher**. You need a company like Word Lions, with incentives (getting paid) that are 100% aligned with getting high quality, **finished work** into your hands

High quality content leads to sales. Don't let yours languish in the Unfinished Valley. The summer is a great time to offload back-burner content development tasks to an experienced finisher.
