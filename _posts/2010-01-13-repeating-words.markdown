I think a lot of us learned a so-called rule about writing in high school or college (deepen your voice and use an authoritative tone when reading the following to yourself):


### "When writing, thou shalt not repeat words or phrases any more than absolutely necessary."


This rule is somewhat applicable to fiction, where repeating words or phrases makes the author look lazy or unimaginative, but in technical and business communication, this "rule" makes the reader work harder.

Here's an example:


These three scenarios examine software licensing costs only. Organizations that already have an investment in tools, personnel, and processes that are based on Widgetco's products can save even more by using Widgetmaster and Widgetizer. The Widgetco solution enables organizations to integrate widgetizing into existing tools, personnel, and processes. This saves management, software, and training costs.


Does this sample repeat the phrase "tools, personnel, and processes"? Yes, it does. Does that repetition kind of dry things up a bit? You could certainly see it that way. But it also reduces the workload on the reader! Consider this alternative, with emphasis added to show how I chose a different phrase the second time instead of repeating "tools, personnel, and processes":


These three scenarios examine software licensing costs only. Organizations that already have an investment in _tools, personnel, and processes_ that are based on Widgetco's products can save even more by using Widgetmaster and Widgetizer. The Widgetco solution enables organizations to integrate widgetizing into existing _toolsets, staffing, and workflows_. This saves management, software, and training costs.


I believe that the second variation of this writing sample is the weaker one because it makes more work for the reader than necessary. If they're sharp, they won't really notice it, but their mind will have to go through the motions of determining whether _toolsets_ is the same thing as _tools_, whether _staffing_ is the same thing as _personnel_, and whether _workflows_ are the same thing as _processes_. That makes extra work for the reader.

Furthermore, they are taking a break from focusing on the **message** of your writing to instead focus on abstract thinking about **analogy** and **word meaning**. In this case, it's just not worth it to follow the "rule" that says you shouldn't be repetitive because that rule makes more work for the reader, and also dilutes the precision of your writing. I believe this is often the case in technical and business communication.

If your goal is to **entertain** your reader, by all means try to avoid repetition in your writing. But if your goal is to **engage** and **inform** you reader, use repetition to enhance clarity and drive your point home!
