Recently, two interesting articles showed up in my RSS reader at almost the same time. Taken together, they illustrate why it’s important to make sure that quality technical content is a fundamental part of any complex product.







## Software is Eating the World


![](http://i2.listal.com/image/1238910/500full.jpg)

In a recent [Wall Street Journal piece](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460.html), Netscape co-founder Marc Andreesen describes the growing role of software in almost all major segments of the world economy. At one point in the article, he writes, “we are in the middle of a dramatic and broad technological and economic shift in which software companies are poised to take over large swathes of the economy.”He refers to this as software “eating the world.”

That’s great news for a lot of companies!

However, as [Alexis Madrigal writes for The Atlantic](http://m.theatlantic.com/technology/print/2011/08/crazy-90-percent-of-people-dont-know-how-to-use-ctrl-f/243840/), when you get a good look at how a lot of folks actually use software, you can see some disturbing trends.


## Most People Lack Even Basic “Power User” Skills


According to studies conducted by Google, “90 percent of people in these studies don’t know how to use CTRL/Command + F to find a word in a document or web page!” Those of us in the technology industry tend to take for granted things like time-saving keyboard shortcuts when we’re using software.


## The Command-F Knowledge Gap?




## But We Write Manuals For Our Stuff


Yeah, but writing manuals or online help–even very thorough help content–is not enough! And if you do it the way most companies do, you’re probably doing it wrong. Manuals that are only or primarily organized around the software’s hierarchy rather than real-world usage patterns and scenarios will only widen the Command-F Knowledge Gap. You have to design customer-facing documentation around the customer’s needs, not yours, and not the software’s.


## Three Ideas For Closing the Command-F Knowledge Gap


We’d like to present three ideas for helping average users obtain skills that would dramatically improve their ability to use common software. These ideas are not exotic, difficult to implement, or even ground-breaking. But I think they could help a lot of hungry software companies sell more product and cultivate a more delighted user base:



	
  1. Ensure potential customer leads and existing customers have easy access to usage-focused software walkthroughs, Hands-on Labs, and other bite-sized instruction that matches common problems they face with step-by-step instructions on using the software. For existing customers, this might be a mailing list auto responder that periodically sends them an installment of a multi-part training program that focuses on “quick wins” and common usage scenarios. For potential customers, this might be video or software demo content that has a prominent placement on your web site and focuses on “quality of life” or effort reduction improvements your software can bring to them.

	
  2. Ask your support people what questions they would like to never hear again. Instead of designing documentation built around the software, build instruction around the problems your users face. You can reduce repetitive support headaches by providing a How-To video or step-by-step when the customer needs it.

	
  3. Incorporate game design into your efforts to educate your customers. Increasing user knowledge and skill using game semantics can help provide the motivation some users need to get across the knowledge gap. For an example of this, see Google’s [A Google A Day](http://agoogleaday.com) campaign.
