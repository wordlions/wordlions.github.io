title: "How Do You Make a Website Fierce?"
---

Word Lions have strong feelings about websites. We think that effective websites, **an Internet presence that moves a company forward**, need to have a structure as well as content that supports the company's story.

When it comes to a company's web presence,
## Word Lions Believe
* **It's worth it** to make engaging, interesting websites. Linking content and structure is the key.
* **Authenticity wins the day**. We have designed a process that helps us write authentic content for you. We begin by learning about you and your company, and from there we build messaging that tells your unique story.
* **Your website visitors' attention is a precious, non-renewable resource**. We design content that is perfect for busy people in search of real value.

## We make these websites, and it goes really smoothly
Because Word Lions love process, we approach the challenge of making great websites as a **process challenge**. Answering this need for our clients forged our content driven design: We call it **Fierce Websites**

Our process builds a website in this order:
![Fierce Websites start with agreeing on the message.](/img/FierceWebsiteProcessSketch-v2.png)

Our Fierce approach makes great sites and makes the process sensible:

* **Cohesive message**. The design, website structure, and content fit together and make sense.
* **The final site is fierce**. It goes out to help you to sell or promote, supporting your other efforts.
* **Budgets don't swell and burst** and timelines don't stretch and snap.
* **Everyone is on the same page, literally**. The messsaging framework means writer, designer, and client are working from the same stated goals and parameters.


Love your website, let it be fierce.
