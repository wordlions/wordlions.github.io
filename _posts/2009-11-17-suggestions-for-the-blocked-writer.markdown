I'm going to add to the already overloaded corpus of "writing about writing" by suggesting some tactics the stalled writer can use to get moving again. The more opportunities I have to write white papers for clients, the more frequently I face that moment of potential stallout. You know, the moment when the writer has said all he knows how to say, and it's not nearly enough. Or alternatively, the moment that doing the most hated 'round-the-house chore would be preferable to writing another paragraph.

Don't get me wrong. I love reading and creating good writing! But I think everyone who writes faces these moments of stalled momentum, even if they love what they are doing. And so, in no particular order, here are some ways that I have helped myself through these types of moments.


## Make A List


Make a list of what you want to say. It can be sentences, phrases, or even single words. Then, after you've written as many things down as you can think of, go back and rewrite the list into sentences (but don't be afraid to use bullet points if that helps!).

Sometimes the mind seems to have an easy time seeing the whole of what you want to say. This is a great time to make The List. At other times, the mind seems to be able to effectively organize things. This is a great time to organize The List. And some times, the mind is on vacation, sipping cocktails in a high-class resort in the Carribean. That's when you pull out the next tactic from this list.


* Write something. Write anything




* Get your body moving for a little bit




* Write what you are trying to say in 1 sentence, then make a list of why or how to support the 1 sentence you just wrote




* Write a letter to a friend or co-worker, explaining what you are writing about. Write it casually, then go back and polish it or improve the structure.




* Resist editing while writing. Learn to turn off the voice from the "inner critic"




## Write Something. Write Anything.


It is said that peace begets more peace, and war begets more war. If this is true, then perhaps writing begets more writing! In other words, if you are trying to write about a certain subject, but find yourself blocked, then write about anything. Chances are, the little taskmaster in your head will find a way to bend the trajectory of what you are writing about back onto target.

If you find that you are trying to write but have been staring at the word processor screen for more than a few moments, consider deploying this tactic. Especially if a deadline is looming, just writing about anything at all can help get that critical momentum going again. As soon as you feel that momentum that comes from "just writing", you can use it to get back on track. Speaking of momentum, you can have intellectual momentum, but sometimes you can start with physical momentum.


## Get Your Body Moving For A Little Bit


You don't have to do something elaborate. Take a walk around the block, or around the office. Do some pushups. Anything to get blood moving. Some of it will accidentally go to your brain, and this may help get you back in the groove. Sometimes, you need to start with extreme simplicity. The next tactic uses simplicity to help you.


## Write What You Are Trying To Say In One Sentence, Then Support It


With this tactic, you write a single sentence that says what you are trying to say in a certain part of your piece. Then, you make a list of supporting details, or arguments, or ideas. Then, you re-write the single sentence and supporting list into beautifully written prose. Remember that you don't need to worry about order or flow when creating your list of supporting details. You can do that part when you are re-writing.

It's good to aim high when you are re-writing, and use the grammar and writing style best suited for your audience. But sometimes, aiming high can cause a lack of enthusiasm, and lead you to stall out. If that happens, I find it useful to lower my aim. That's the purpose of the next tactic.


## Write A Personal Letter


Write a letter to a friend or co-worker, explaining a piece or all of what you are trying to write about. Dictate it to yourself if you have to. Write it casually, then go back and polish it and improve the structure.

If you use this tactic, you'll have to push the pause button on your Inner Critic, who will be saying "Hey, you're on a deadline and you're writing a letter to your friend! Get back to work!"


## Pause the Inner Critic


The Inner Critic can be tremendously helpful at certain phases of the writing process, and tremendously destructive at other times. Don't deliver a piece of writing to your boss or client without letting your Inner Critic AND someone else' Inner Critic review it. However, when you are blocked and feeling low on momentum, your Inner Critic usually makes it worse by keeping your writing pace at a crawl. During these times, your Inner Critic will want to go back and edit, and re-edit, and re-re-edit everything you've written thus far, and restrain you from writing anything new.

Push the pause button on the Inner Critic for a few sentences or paragraphs. This may help you build up momentum so that you can be more productive or creative in your writing. Then, when you've written a great first draft, you can push the play button on your Inner Critic and let the red ink pour!

The next tactic is for writing ninjas only. Stretch first.


## Do A Writing Sprint


My last tactic involves what I call a Writing Sprint. In a Writing Sprint, you set a timer for 10 or 15 minutes and write as much as you can as quickly as you can until the timer stops. During a Writing Sprint, the email and browser programs are CLOSED! Put your word processor in full-screen mode if it has one. No editing is allowed during a Writing Sprint.


## Coda


I hope these tactics are as useful to you as they are to me! Remember that in writing, there is a time for rapid movement, and there is a time for careful contemplation. Keep these two elements in balance and you will create your best work.

In closing, I can't resist referring you to another excellent piece of writing on writing, by Paul Graham: [http://www.paulgraham.com/writing44.html](http://www.paulgraham.com/writing44.html)
