We love A5 notebooks. Or at least Philip does. Here's why.


### They're Baggable

The [A5 paper size](http://www.papersizes.org/a-paper-sizes.htm) is a nice middle ground between the more conventional letter and legal sizes (A4 is the nearest ISO standard) and those tiny black Moleskine notebooks that you see beret-wearing wanna-be authors using in cafes.

One of the nice advantages of A5 notebooks is that they slip right into a laptop bag or other handy conveyance. They are less bulky than letter size notebooks, and they fit a wider variety of bags.

### They'reÂ Just Big Enough

The A5 paper size is large enough to get a real _idea_ onto a single page of the notebook; the _whole_ idea. Notes from an hour long meeting, a new product idea, whatever. It's just enough tabula rosa. Goldilocks would love it.

The combination of baggability and size is a real sweet spot for me, and I'm now a committed fan of A5 size notebooks.
