The Word Lions are a bookish bunch. More bookish than worldly, I imagine. And so we read a lot. We read books, we read blogs, and we read any scrap of interesting writing we find anywhere.

It doesn't happen often, but occasionally the reading interest conflicts with the writing time, and we have a productivity challenge. There are just so many interesting folks doing good writing out there! So for Philip and Joel, it's [Instapaper](http://instapaper.com) to the rescue.

Instapaper often resolves the conflict between the desire to read that interesting thing we stumbled across while researching that productive thing we're actually working on at the moment. Instead of interrupting the productive work, we can add that article to an Instapaper queue and read it later.

The itch to read that interesting thing gets scratched without turning productive time into lost time. Everybody wins!
