This is an update to one of our most popular posts: [Things We Love: Clicky keyboards](http://wordlions.com/things-we-love-clicky-keyboards/).

A few months ago, I ranted about my affection for mechanical keyswitch keyboards. As a writer, having an accurate, responsive keyboard is important, and I was able to meet that need with the relatively inexpensive keyboard Solidtek ASK-6600.

Well, the urge to keep exploring high-end keyboards struck again, and I got a [Realforce 86U](http://www.elitekeyboards.com/products.php?sub=topre_keyboards,rftenkeyless&pid=rf_se0700). This keyboard uses the highly-regarded Topre rubber dome keyswitch. Rubber dome keyswitches are used in some truly awful keyboards, but as it turns out, that does not mean that rubber dome keyswitches are themselves awful.

In fact, they can be a real delight. I **love**Â my Realforce 86U! It makes less noise than my Solidtek ASK-6600, it has an ergonomic design that works very well for fast, accurate touch typing, and a springy, precise feel to the keyswitches.

It's a spendy little keyboard, but I can see myself being very happy with this keyboard for a long time!

By the way, "The good feeling of oneness with cup rubber" is the hilariously garbled english tag line printed on the Realforce product box.
