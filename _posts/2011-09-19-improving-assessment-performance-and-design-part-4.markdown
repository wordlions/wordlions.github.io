This post continues our series on the common flaws we've found in assessment tests (and how to exploit those as a test-taker). After we finish describing the common flaws, we'll talk about how to avoid those flaws through better assessment design.


## **Targeting Your Domain Knowledge Study**


Just like you can intelligently analyze test question structure during the exam, you can intelligently target your domain knowledge study while preparing for the exam. Here are my tips for maximizing the effectiveness of your exam preparation:


### Tip 1: Focus on Concepts First, Trivia Last


Think of your mind like a closet. Details are like the items in the closet. Concepts are like the hooks and hangars that you hang the details on. Without a conceptual understanding of how a piece of software works, you will lack hooks to support the details about that software. For example, how can you make sense of the details about how a network packet is handled if you don't understand the big picture (the concept) of how packets flow between computers on a network? How can you make sense of the differences between two VPN encrption algorithms if you don't understand the overall VPN setup and data transfer process on a high level?

So make sure you understand the concepts of how a piece of software works first before you focus on details you might be tested on in the certification exam.


### Tip 2: Identify Software Deltas


Find out what has changed (the deltas) between the current and previous version of the software you are studying. Exam writers want to make sure that you have current domain knowledge, so they tend to focus a significant percentage (maybe 20% on some exams) of exam questions on new features, procedures, and functionality for the current version of the software. So identify the deltas to the most recent version of the software, and expand your domain knowledge of how to use these new features, procedures, and capabilities.


### Tip 3: Identify Software Best Practices


Many test questions test your understanding of software best practices, rather than details about the software itself. Knowing software best practices will help you with questions that have several correct answers, but only one best answer. The best answer will be identified because it adheres to software best practices.


### Tip 4: Learn Interfaces and Procedures


Make sure you have seen and used every interface the software offers, and you have configured, used, and re-configured every function it can perform. Make sure you can identify and understand:



	
* Every feature described on the software's website

	
* Every menu option

	
* Every configuration setting


Make sure you get plenty hands-on usage of the software. Setting the software up in a Virtual Machine is often a great way to do this.


### Tip 5: Identify Software Limits


Sometimes exam writers run out of good questions to ask, so they resort to trivial questions about the limits of the software in question. "How many widgets can this software support?" "If you install parts A, B, and D of the software, will it make coffee for you or not?" These types of questions focus on:



	
* What the software can not do

	
* Built-in limits to what the software can do


As you are preparing for an exam, pay particular attention to details of this nature.
