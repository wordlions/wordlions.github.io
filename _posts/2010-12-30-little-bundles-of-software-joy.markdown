One of the exquisitely enjoyable moments of doing what the Word Lions do just happened. It involved a spell check dictionary, two Macs, and a bundle of newborn software joy.

Joel and I have been working with this particular client for the better part of a year now. He and his team are writing an impressive piece of software for the electric utility industry.

The project has been one of those dream projects. You know, the right combination of good management, great customer, and clear communication.

And then it happened!

The customer officially named the product. He moved from a mouthfull of acronymn to a clever, memorable camel-cased product name!

And the Word Lions, with their faithful Macintosh axes, got to do one of the things we _really_ love: add a new word to our spell check dictionaries. One that we're proud of and excited to see grow up into an effective, well-understood software tool.

Congratulations Michael! We feel like proud uncles.
