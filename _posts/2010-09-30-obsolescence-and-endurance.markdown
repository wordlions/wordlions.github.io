Moving a bunch of books and the like around the other day, I came across an old copy of [Cabinet Magazine](http://www.cabinetmagazine.org) dated Spring 2006. Cabinet is a delightfully eclectic quarterly I pick up from time to time.  I had not read this issue all the way through and fell upon an article by Sam Burton that opens with the tale of [Alves Reis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alves_dos_Reis), a fascinating, bold Portugese counterfeiter of the early 20th century. It was a great read and I felt somewhat sad for Sam that the effort went into an article that is now so far out of circulation.

Cabinet does not release their articles freely on the Internet, so only pack rats like me are reading the article these days. In the latter portion of the article, Burton makes some really interesting points about the value of money and language that are just as relevant now as they were in 2006. Indeed, after our recent financial crisis, it is even more alluring to call into question the significance of paper money.
