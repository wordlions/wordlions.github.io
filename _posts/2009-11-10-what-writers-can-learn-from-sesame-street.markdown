Today while stretching -- a routine made more interesting by two small dogs who see stretching as an acrobatic social occasion -- I heard this great article on NPR about the [40th anniversary of Sesame Street](http://wordlions.com/s/43838/).  The reporter had some fun with the subject.  How could he resist?  By creating a list of lessons that The Street has learned over the years, he got my attention and created a really enjoyable listening experience.

Of course, I am deeply influenced by Sesame Street.  Most of my generation can still sing the first few bars of a hundred Sesame Street jingles. What follows is my


## Writer's Lessons From 40 years of Sesame Street

1. **Keep It Simple**. Decide what your message is going to be and don't complicate it.  Every Sesame Street segment has one message and one message only.  Jokes, storyline, and "color" don't distract from the message.  "Cookie cookie cookie starts with C."
2. **Keep It Short**.  Segments on Sesame Street are short.  Although there may be a longer storyline, it is broken up into manageable chunks.  While this is supposedly for the shorter attention spans of children, it holds true for technical communications as well.  No one wants to stare at an unbroken page of text or a 30 minute timeline.  Break your message into short sections and arrange them for easy consumption.
3. **Come Back to Mr. Snuffleupagus (or Elmo).** My favorite character was Mr. Snuffleupagus. I loved the agony of Big Bird trying to get people to see his mysterious friend.  It kept me on the edge of my seat, even though I was sitting on the floor.  I understand that Elmo has risen high in popularity, driving kids wild with his exuberant, childlike ways. Whatever keeps them watching.  Even when creating informative writing, narrative has power. Write in a way that is interesting and engaging does not detract from your subject but rather enhances the value of your document. Feel free to allude at the front of the document about value at the end.  Keep them in their seats.


It is easy to forget these lessons, thinking that the rules we learned as children were the "basic" rules and as adults we had moved on to more "advanced" writing.  I have come to understand that all communications should be edited while sitting on the stoop on Sesame Street with Grover looking over your shoulder.
