A German company named Datango followed me on Twitter. Of course, I was interested in knowing what they do, so I checked out their [web page](http://datango.com). WOW, they make some software that looks great! While reading their Product description page, I felt that the **purpose** and **value** of their product could be expressed more strongly.

I really believe that you should **not hold back** when you are talking about what your product does and why a customer should hand over money to buy it. Of course, your **tone** should be correct for your intended audience. By that, I mean it should **match** the tone in which your customers generally speak while also **leading** them into a state of mind that is conducive to buying your product.


## Yes, It Could Be Better


So with a steely glint in my eyes, I set a timer for 45 minutes and gave myself the challenge of improving the copy on Datango's product page.

First, here's the original copy (be sure to click the image to see a full-resolution version):

## Some Ideas For Betterment


While re-writing the copy for this page, I felt like the following things could be improved:



	
  * Don't put the product name in quotes. In US English, quotes around a word or phrase indicate that you intend the reader to look for a secondary meaning for that word or phrase, or in some cases that you intend a sarcastic tone.

	
  * Remove the word **product** at the top of the copy. It's redundant with the menu bar at page top.

	
  * Remove the tag line from the top of the copy. It raises more questions than it answers.

	
  * Be more clear about **what the product does**. Bullet lists are often a great way to do this.

	
  * Add more **value statements**. This has to be woven in to the copy throughout.

	
  * Take a bit of emphasis **off the company**. Of course, the quality and reputation of the company is important, but this particular page on the web site is focused on the **product**, and so the focus should stay there.

	
  * Attempt to link the product to the **problem it solves**.




## Better, Version 1




Here's what I came up with, in two versions. First, one with key points bolded (be sure to click the image to see a full-resolution version):

## Better, Version 2




And one without the bolding, for a more subtle tone (be sure to click the image to see a full-resolution version):

(By the way, my 45 minute timer just went off as I was typing this part of the blog post!)
