- What Word Lions Do

One of the things Word Lions does is design and author software training. From time to time, this entails creating quizzes or tests to assess whether learners have retained and integrated new concepts and details.

Our understanding of how to create effective assessments is based on a lot of experience taking other people’s assessments. In the course of taking dozens of assessments, we’ve identified common design flaws and actually learned to exploit these flaws. In other words, we’re “good test takers.”

In this blog series, we’d like to first present the results of our experience exploiting design flaws in assessments, then we’ll make recommendations for how to avoidthese same flaws in assessments.


## Our Credentials


Philip has attempted and passed 17 Microsoft software certification exams and earned 6 certifications. In the process he has learned a few things about software certification exams, and we think they might apply to other multiple-choice software certification exams:



	
  * Domain knowledge (factual knowledge of the exam subject) is important but by itself is often not enough to make you successful on a multiple-choice exam.

	
  * Understanding the exam format and analyzing the structure of each question can help you eliminate wrong answers (thereby raising the odds of a correct guess), even if your domain knowledge is insufficient to point out the correct answer for a given question.

	
  * Good domain knowledge combined with an understanding of a few exam-taking techniques described below can raise your success rate on certification exams.




## Reverse Engineering the Exam Format


Here are my tips for “reverse engineering” the exam format. The goal of all these tips is to help you quickly weed out wrong answers so that you can have more time to use your domain knowledge to choose the correct or best answer. These tips apply almost exclusively to multiple-choice text-based questions, not questions that use a simulated software environment. More quickly choosing the correct or best answer for each question does two beneficial things:



	
  * Reduces the chance the exam time limit will expire before you have completed the exam and reviewed any questions you are not sure about (if the exam format allows question marking for review).

	
  * Reduces your fatigue, raising your chances of correctly answering questions that occur later in the exam.


By the way, make sure you know the difference between a correct and a best answer! Many software certification exams will present two or three answers that correctly address the question, but one of those answers will entail less effort or time and that makes it the “best” answer. Exam instructions will tell you whether you need to choose correct answers or best answers.


## Tip 1: Read the Question Backwards


Many certification exam questions are lengthy, and provide multiple supporting details or a scenario that is related to the question. The typical question structure looks like this:



	
  1. Scenario

	
  2. Description of the Problem you have to solve

	
  3. List of Answers, each of which is one potential way to solve the problem


Because the Scenario section can often be lengthy, by the time you reach the second section that describes the Problem you must solve, you may have lost track of important details in the scenario. This forces you to go back and read the scenario a second time, costing you time on that question. Why not read the question in the following order:

	
  1. Description of the Problem you have to solve (often the last sentence or paragraph in the question)

	
  2. List of Answers, one of which may “jump out” at you as the correct answer.

	
  3. Lastly, read the Scenario to make sure you haven’t missed anything.


By approaching the question in this order, you might save a minute or two on some questions, and on timed exams this can be crucial. If your domain knowledge is particularly good, you can scan or entirely skip reading the Scenario section if one of the answers is obviously correct, further saving time and reducing fatigue.

If you do need to read the Scenario, you will do so after reading the description of the Problem you must solve and after reading the potential answers. As you read the Scenario, you will be prepared to mentally filter out parts of the Scenario that have nothing or little to do with the Problem. This will help focus your thinking as you evaluate the answers to the question.

The next installment of this blog post series will have more test-taking tips.
