I've just finished reading Jonathan Kantor's _[Crafting White Paper 2.0](http://www.amazon.com/Crafting-White-Paper-2-0-Attention-Challenged/dp/0557163242)_, and I'm impressed. The author has condensed the why and how of reaching short-attention span readers into a highly-readable 146 pages. You can read the TOC and other descriptive information on Jonathan's book on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Crafting-White-Paper-2-0-Attention-Challenged/dp/0557163242) or [Lulu](http://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/crafting-white-paper-20-designing-information-for-todays-time-and-attention-challenged-business-reader/5983721), so I'll skip the standard book review boilerplate and focus on how the book was a bit of an eye-opener for me.


### This Book Has Helped Me Improve My Game


 These visual elements are like a bulls-eye for the distracted eye. This is where you put condensed statements that help the reader understand that, yes, their is something for them in this paper. I think Kantor does a bang-up job of explaining how to create a white paper that uses these elements effectively. 

I've been writing white papers for two years now, and I'll be the first person to tell you that I've got room to learn new techniques. While writing, I try to imagine my typical reader sitting in an airplane trying to read my white paper, a snoring seat-mate to their right and a crying baby to their left.



	
* Will they be able to navigate the document effectively?

	
* Will I lose their attention?

	
* Will they get the key informational and marketing messages even with all that chaos in their surroundings?


I think my white papers answer these challenges pretty well, but Kantor's book has explained a whole new level to how to create papers that speak to short-attention span readers. (That's easily 90% of all readers today!) Reaching these readers has as much to do with layout and organization as with crisp, well-written text, and that's where I learned a lot from Kantor's book.


### The Big Idea: Layered Reading


The main point that Kantor makes about today's typical white paper reader is that they don't just sit down and read the white paper through from beginning to end. Especially if they're a higher level decision-maker in an organization. They first scan the document for clues that it's going to be worth their limited time. If the paper passes this test, then the reader will give it more time. If it doesn't, it's hello wastebasket or delegated reading for an underling.


### You Have to Create Visual Focus Zones

All writers know that overly big blocks of uninterrupted text are a big turnoff to most readers. And we also know that "overly big" has been getting smaller and smaller.

The value for me in [Crafting White Paper 2.0](http://www.amazon.com/Crafting-White-Paper-2-0-Attention-Challenged/dp/0557163242) is that Kantor presents a nice system for adding visual elements to a white paper (along with helpful suggested pages-to-graphics ratios) to help readers scan it for valuable content. The visual elements suggested are things like callouts, or pull quotes, shaded text blocks, diagrams, and the like.

These visual elements are like a bulls-eye for the distracted eye. This is where you put condensed statements that help the reader understand that, yes, their is something for them in this paper. I think Kantor does a bang-up job of explaining how to create a white paper that uses these elements effectively.


### The Bottom Line: Would I Buy This Book Again?


I sure would. In addition to what I've mentioned, there's plenty of other, valuable content in the book:



	
* Resource lists

	
* Helpful illustrations

	
* Example white paper excerpts

	
* Lots of other prescriptive guidance to help a white paper writer produce better papers


I could find a few things to criticize, but in light of the value this book offers, they're just not worth mentioning. Excellent work, Mr. Kantor! You've helped this white paper writer step up his game.
