So, you're thinking about writing a white paper? After all, Fall and Winter are the best time of year to write white papers! (Actually, there's no white paper season. Their production tends to be driven by marketing budgets and product release schedules more than anything else.)


## To Write In House or Not?
While it's not the point of this article, you of course will want to think about whether you want to write your white paper in-house or not. While almost no one will know more about the subject than your staff, the chances are high that charging a full time staff person with writing a white paper will land it in the [unfinished valley](/finishing-it).

## The Prep Is Almost The Same Either Way
Whether you do the writing in house or not, you will want your subject matter experts (SMEs) to prep for writing process in basically the same way.

Word Lions has written for both small and large players on both business and technical subjects and have helped construct a lot of persuasive content like white papers. Through that experience, we've learned that writing a persuasive write paper is based largely on:

1. **Resonance** with the audience's concerns. This means that the paper can convince them you have the solution to a pressing problem that they would like solved. It also means that when they read the paper they see themselves (their vernacular, their real-life concerns, and their thought patterns) mirrored in the content.
2. **Authority** on the subject. This happens through both overt and subtle cues. The subtle cues are the precise, formal tone of the writing, and the relative formality and austerity of the visual presentation. The overt cues are content that prompts the reader to think, "Oh, I didn't know that but I'm glad I do now!" or "Yes, that sounds right." or "These people do know what they're talking about."
3. **Framing** the discussion properly. This is relevant to all white papers, but especially to those that are making a competitive argument, like saying "you should buy Product ABC instead of Product XYZ." My favorite easily-accessible example of framing is related to Apple's iPhone product line. When the original iPhone was released, the dominant frame that defined mobile devices was that they were great telephones with a small amount of mobile computing ability added on, generally focused on email. The value proposition of the iPhone was in essence saying, "What you really want is a great multi-purpose mobile computer that also makes phone calls." Apple was able to follow through on that framing argument by delivering a device that had a highly-usable interface, especially with respect to the mobile browser. Subsequent releases of the iPhone continue to expand the "great mobile computer that also makes phone calls" value proposition, and the entire mobile device industry was upended as a result.

## SME Prep Strategies

The following are some critical points that your SME(s) should be prepared to talk with a white paper author about:

* **Think about how you sell the product or service that is the subject of your white paper**. How do you pitch it to people when time is short (the so-called elevator pitch), how do you counter their objections to the price or other common objections, etc?
* **Think about the competition**. What does your product or service offer that they do not? These are your product's differentiators, and they can be very overt, like yours having features or benefits or a price advantage that the competition does not, or they can be subtle, like yours being easier to use or better-designed or the like.
* **Think about benefits vs. features**. A feature is something like "modular design with 1-on-1 followup sessions." A benefit is "learn 20% more in 30% less time, with proven information retention and 20% better on-the-job performance," for example. Features matter, but (substantiated) benefits ultimately sell. Benefits have a clear relationship to value, performance, and results. Read more about [features and benefits here](/features-benefits-and-value/). So do spend some time thinking about the headline features of your product or service and especially about the product or service's benefits.
* **Think about real-world product performance**. What do your customers tell you their needs are, how does the product actually satisfy those needs, and so forth.
