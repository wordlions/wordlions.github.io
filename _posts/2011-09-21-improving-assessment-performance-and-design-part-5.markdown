This post continues our series on the common flaws we've found in assessment tests (and how to exploit those as a test-taker). After we finish describing the common flaws, we'll talk about how to avoid those flaws through better assessment design.


## Putting the Pieces Together


Here's the exam-taking approach I'm suggesting, from beginning to end:



	
  1. Get a conceptual understanding of how the software works

	
  2. Learn what features and capabilities are new to the current version of the software

	
  3. Learn best practices for using the software

	
  4. Learn the limits of the software

	
  5. Learn any other details you can about the software

	
  6. Get plenty of rest before the exam. Make sure you are not hungry, thirsty, or unwell during the exam.

	
  7. Read questions backwards. Identify the problem to be solved, then evaluate potential answers and the scenario in light of the problem to be solved.

	
  8. Use the techniques above to identify Distractors and wrong answers.

	
  9. From the remaining answers, choose a best answer using your domain knowledge.


In the next installment of this series, we'll start discussing how to mitigate common assessment design flaws in order to create more effective assessments.
