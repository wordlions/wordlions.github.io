This post continues our series on the common flaws we've found in assessment tests (and how to exploit those as a test-taker). After we finish describing the common flaws, we'll talk about how to avoid those flaws through better assessment design.


## Tip 2: Eliminate Distractors


Distractors are wrong answers. Distractors can range from "close but no cigar" to patently wrong. Over the course of my personal experience with many certification exams, I have noticed some patterns that are common to many Distractors. Remember, your goal is to use your domain knowledge to choose the correct/best answer to every question on a certification exam, but the more quickly you can weed out wrong answers, the more time available to you to choose the best answer from among the correct answers. Developing your ability to spot distractors is _very useful_.


### **Syntax Clues**


Good technical writing uses [parallel structure ](http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/644/01/)when creating lists of items. This technical writing norm often appears in certification exams as well, with the list of potential answers for a question using parallel structure. **Look for any exceptions to parallel structure when reading the list of potential answers**. An answer that deviates from parallel structure is likely one of the following:



	
  * A poorly written distractor.

	
  * A correct/best answer.


Wait, really? You can identify the correct answer just by its grammar? Based on my experience, I would say that 15% of the time it is possible to use only your ability to spot exceptions to parallel list structure to identify a correct answer even if you have little or no domain knowledge that is relevant to that question. Remember, that some exam questions have several correct answers, and after you have weeded out the distractors you must choose the _best_ answer from among the _correct_ answers, so weeding out the distractors is only part of the challenge.

I'm going into speculation mode here, so treat this as a sidebar, but I suspect that Distractors are often written by someone who lacks the domain knowledge of the person/team who wrote the correct answer. This could cause a small, but perciptible, difference in the grammar or sentence structure of the Distractor answer(s).

It's very difficult to write good Distractors. And sometimes, as a test-taker, you just get lucky when the exam authors overshoot and put in a Distractor that is just patently wrong. Often you can use your domain knowledge to determine which Distractors are patently wrong or infeasible.


### **Factual Clues**


****Look closely for references to non-existent interface components or wrong procedures. The ability to spot Distractors based on factual clues is dependent on your level of domain knowledge, but remember that Distractors often use the following format:

Answer = _correct procedure_ + _fictitious software interface name_

OR

Answer = _incorrect procedure_ + _correct software interface name_

Distractors that follow either of the above two formats fall into the "close but no cigar" category and can be ruled out immediately.

Remember that many software companies use fairly strict style guides when naming interface components, and they try to keep interface names consistent. Distractors that reference fictitious interface components or procedures that don't exist in the actual product sometimes _clearly_ and _obviously_ deviate from the usual style guide norms for interface components. This can be a subtle clue that a potential answer is actually a Distractor.


### **Logical Stretches**


Distractors will often outline a procedure that deviates from best practices or something that is just not possible in the software you are being tested on. This is why, when you are working on your domain knowledge in preparation for the exam, you want to focus on best practices and limits to what the software can do. These two areas easily lend themselves to the challenge of writing test questions, and so they are obvious candidates for your domain knowledge preparation. More on this below.
