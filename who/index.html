                <p>Joel started out as a telecommunications tech and IT administrator. He has been writing and structuring content for over ten years now, largely for technology and B2B offerings. Joel savors his new role teaching other writers the Word Lions Way. If you criticize yippie small dogs, he will flash a patient, indulgent smile and later introduce you to Torito, the chihuahua that will change your mind.</p>

              <p>Over the years, Erik's code has sold guitars, balanced server loads, and served up any number of web services. Along with his understanding of the underpinnings of applications, Word Lions put his affinity for research to work. We could all stand to learn a little bit about proper attire from Erik.</p>

              <p>Karl has been tweaking technology since the days of VisiCalc on the Apple ][+.
