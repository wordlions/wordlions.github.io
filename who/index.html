      <h3>It has always been about turning on the lights.</h3>
      <p>The two principals of Word Lions, Philip Morgan and Joel Barker, separately moved from technology to content.</p>

      <p>As network administrators and consultants, that light was the little green LED on computer that shows it is connected to the network.</p>

      <p>Then, Philip and Joel began turning on the lights in people by writing technical procedures and delivering technical training. Today, Philip and Joel lead Word Lions projects where they turn on lights for entire markets. They teamed up in 2009 to create <strong>honest, influential, fierce</strong> content.<p>
