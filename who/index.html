                 <h3>Principal and Writer</h3>
                <p>After a first career in telecommunications and IT, Joel Barker took on the communication challenges of marketing technology. For 10 years he has been writing and structuring content, largely for technology and B2B offerings. As Word Lions grows, he savors the experience of teaching other writers the Word Lions Way. If you criticize yippie small dogs, he will flash a patient, indulgent smile and later introduce you to Torito, the chihuahua that will change your mind.</p>
