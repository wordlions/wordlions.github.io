# TODO

* Get consistent image sizes happening for the thumbnails on the /what page
* Verify that problem with next button is resolved
* Error-check all content, links, etc.
* Wire up form for contact page (or just make it a traditional vcard-ey thing, but ask Joel if it's OK to publish the company address there)
* Improve the logo in the title bar

* Update color theme to custom theme
