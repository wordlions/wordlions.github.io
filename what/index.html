    <p>Microsoft Certified Trainers are not known to pull punches. Reviews of Microsoft Learning (MSL) courses are often…harsh, shall we say.

Getting feedback like this from MCTs on an MSL course is like a perfect 10 in the Olympics. It’s rare, it’s meaningful, and it speaks to the excellence of Philip’s work.</p>
