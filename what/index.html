  <p>“I thought it was the best course in the Server 2008 Portfolio.”</p>
    <p>“Everything worked for us….”</p>
    <p>“The best course on Windows Server 2008 till now.”</p>

    <p>Microsoft Certified Trainers are not known to pull punches. Reviews of Microsoft Learning (MSL) courses are often…harsh, shall we say. However, Philip’s modules in the “Configuring, Managing, and Maintaining Windows Server 2008? course received high praise. Getting feedback like this from MCTs on an MSL course is like a perfect 10 in the Olympics. It’s rare, it’s meaningful, and it speaks to the excellence of Philip’s work.</p>
